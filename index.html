                Olaoluwa Olamide John Talabi popularly known as Laolu is a tall, dark-skin 30 years old man with above average intelligence and an uncommon voice. <br>
                I honestly don't know how to write a biography so this will probably end up being a description of Laolu through my eyes.

            Laolu has a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Master's in Business Administration, so you already know he's a bit of a nerd because the process of acquiring a Bachelor alone was exhausting for me.
            He makes a living via forex trading.

            I met Laolu in November, 2020 after chatting for almost a decade first via BBM then Whatsapp. 
            <br>
            I mean imagine texting and calling someone for almost 10 years but never seeing his face, I know right?! Wonders of the internet.
            <br>
            Laolu to me is a friend who I'd like to smack every now and then. He's the most organized guy I've met. He sings, plays the guitar and drums, he enjoys travelling, reading, watching movies and interacting with people.
            <br>
            He's patient, jovial, open minded, adventurous, loves food and can cook. On our second meeting, he made me spaghetti and sauce, that's a pass in my book.
            He hates tardiness and dishonesty. <br>
            If a girl ever comes across this and Laolu and I aren't married (shhh it's a secret), he is from Ogun state, God-fearing and naughty. Oh his favourite colour is black.
